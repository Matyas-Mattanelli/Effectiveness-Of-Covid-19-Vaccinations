### The impact of vaccinations on the number of Covid-19 cases

- The aim of this project is to analyze the effects of the number of newly vaccinated on the number of new cases of Covid-19. For this purpose, we utilize a data set covering 103 countries
  with monthly observations between December 2020 and December 2021. By estimating a dynamic panel data model with the Difference and System GMM estimators we find that vaccinations appear to affect the number of new cases with a one month lag. The relationship seems to be negative and statistically significant.
- The complete analysis is available in [Analysis.pdf](Analysis.pdf)
- The R code with the estimation is available in [Analysis.R](code/Analysis.R)
- The compiled data set can be found in [dataset.csv](data/dataset.csv)
